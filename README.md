# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🎯 Objective
To learn how to spot potentially harmful browser extensions, evaluate their permissions, and remove suspicious or unnecessary ones to improve browser security.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (Extensions Manager)

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Opened the browser’s extensions/add-ons manager.
2. Reviewed all installed extensions carefully.
3. Checked permissions and verified whether each extension was necessary.
4. Identified unused or suspicious extensions.
5. Removed the suspicious/unnecessary extensions.
6. Restarted the browser to ensure everything worked correctly.

## 📸 Screenshots
- Screenshot of all installed extensions.
- Screenshot of the extension list after removal.

## ⚠️ Findings

- Found the following extensions:
  - **Free VPN for Chrome – VPN Proxy VeePN** → VPN extensions can sometimes log browsing activity. Kept for now, but noted as a potential risk if not from a trusted developer.
  - **TeraBox Download Assistant** → Removed, as it requested broad permissions related to downloads and browsing activity.
  - **YouGov Safe** → Removed, since it tracks browsing activity in exchange for rewards, which poses a privacy concern.
  - **Google Docs Offline** and **McAfee WebAdvisor** → Safe and kept.

## ✅ Actions Taken
- Removed **TeraBox Download Assistant** and **YouGov Safe** to reduce privacy and security risks.
- Kept **Free VPN for Chrome – VPN Proxy VeePN**, but will monitor and consider replacing with a trusted standalone VPN application.

## 📝 Key Learnings
- Browser extensions can pose security risks if they have broad permissions (e.g., “Read and change all your data on all websites”).
- Only install extensions from trusted sources and developers.
- Regularly review and clean up extensions to maintain browser performance and security.
- Malicious extensions can be used to steal passwords, track activity, or deliver malware.
